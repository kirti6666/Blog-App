# Blog-App

In this full stack project tutorial we will build a blog app or blogging platform using MongoDB, Express, React and Node JS. In this full stack blog platform we will integrate the AI Feature (artificial intelligence) to generate the blog content. 

In this blog portal we will build the admin dashboard also, where admin can post a new blog and manage existing blogs and comments. After building this full stack blog portal we will deploy it online using vercel.
